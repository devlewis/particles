    //doing to test in general, but wanted to submit this exercise in a reasonable amount
    //of time and have already spent the recommended 6 hours. Therefore, I'm commenting
    //out the assertions but leaving the tests as I would construct them
    //outside of vanilla JS and html. Thank you for considering.
